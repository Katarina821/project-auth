# Project Auth API

This week we built an API with authentication to implement a registration flow, and a frontend with forms to register, sign in, and view some content once you're logged in.

## The problem

We used MongodB and Mongoose to build our Backend Express API. During the project we validated the endpoints using Postman. 

This API has 4 endpoints:
1: A POST endpoint to create a new user. 2: A POST endpoint for the existing users to log in. 3: A GET endpoint to receive restricted data based on the validation of user through access token. 4: A GET endpoint to display restricted content.

After this we deployed our backend with heroku. Finally we built a frontend using React and Redux. With styling in CSS.
